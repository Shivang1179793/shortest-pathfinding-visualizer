This is a visualizer that finds the shortest path from a source to a destination, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and data structures and algorithms (DSA). Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find the shortest path, following the principles used in Google Maps. The project utilizes React.js along with the Leaflet library, an open-source mapping library that interfaces with OpenStreetMap (OSM) API, a free geographic database.

React-Leaflet provides React components that seamlessly integrate with Leaflet, enabling the display and interaction with maps. The OSM API serves as the backend data source, providing map tiles and geographic data, which are then rendered by Leaflet through React-Leaflet.

Users can select both the source and destination points on the map interactively. Additionally, a wall feature is incorporated, restricting the path where walls are placed. This means that paths cannot traverse through areas where walls are present, enhancing the realism of the visualization. Furthermore, users can assign weights to the paths, influencing the algorithm's preference for certain routes. Paths with lower weights are prioritized in the search for the shortest path on the map.

In essence, this visualizer combines various technologies and algorithms to offer an interactive and dynamic platform for finding the shortest path between two points on a map, allowing users to customize their preferences and obstacles for an optimal route.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
